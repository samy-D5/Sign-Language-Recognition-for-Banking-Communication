# Sign Language Recognition for Banking Communication

## Overview
The **Sign Language Recognition for Banking Communication** project aims to bridge communication gaps between sign language users and bank staff. By utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this application recognizes hand signs and converts them into spoken commands, thereby enhancing accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features
- **Real-Time Sign Recognition**: Detects and recognizes hand signs in real-time using computer vision.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts recognized signs into spoken words for seamless communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use by both sign language users and bank staff.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Can be deployed on various devices and operating systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing
  - [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) for hand tracking
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning
  - [gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) for voice synthesis
